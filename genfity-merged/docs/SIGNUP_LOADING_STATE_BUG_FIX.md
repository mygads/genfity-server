# Signup Page - Loading State Bug Fix

## Problem Description
**Bug**: All buttons showed loading state simultaneously when any single action was triggered.

**Root Cause**: Single `isLoading` state was shared across multiple independent actions:
- Sign Up form submission
- OTP verification
- Resend OTP code

**User Impact**: Confusing UX where clicking "Verify" would also disable "Resend Code" button and vice versa.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Separate Loading States**
Replaced single loading state with specific states for each action:

```typescript
// Before (problematic)
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false)

// After (fixed)
const [isSignupLoading, setIsSignupLoading] = useState(false)
const [isVerifyLoading, setIsVerifyLoading] = useState(false)
const [isResendLoading, setIsResendLoading] = useState(false)
```

### 2. **Updated Action Functions**
Each function now manages its own loading state:

```typescript
// Signup Form
const handleSignupSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  setIsSignupLoading(true)
  try {
    // ... signup logic
  } finally {
    setIsSignupLoading(false)
  }
}

// OTP Verification
const handleVerifyOtp = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  setIsVerifyLoading(true)
  try {
    // ... verification logic
  } finally {
    setIsVerifyLoading(false)
  }
}

// Resend OTP
const handleResendOtp = async (event: React.MouseEvent) => {
  setIsResendLoading(true)
  try {
    // ... resend logic
  } finally {
    setIsResendLoading(false)
  }
}
```

### 3. **Updated UI Components**
Each button now uses its specific loading state:

```typescript
// Sign Up Button
<button
  disabled={isSignupLoading || !name || !email || !phone || !password || phoneValid === false}
>
  {isSignupLoading ? <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" /> : null}
  {t('form.signUpButton')}
</button>

// Verify Button
<button
  disabled={isVerifyLoading || otp.join("").length !== 4}
>
  {isVerifyLoading ? <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" /> : null}
  {t('verification.verify')}
</button>

// Resend Button
<button
  disabled={isResendLoading || resendCooldown > 0}
>
  {isResendLoading ? <Loader2 className="mr-2 h-4 w-4 animate-spin" /> : null}
  {resendCooldown > 0 ? `${t('verification.resendCode')} (${resendCooldown}s)` : t('verification.resendCode')}
</button>

// Back to Form Button
<button
  disabled={isVerifyLoading || isResendLoading}  // Disabled when verification actions are running
>
  <ArrowLeft className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />
  {t('verification.backToForm')}
</button>
```

## Behavior After Fix

### Independent Loading States:
✅ **Sign Up Button**: Only shows loading during form submission  
✅ **Verify Button**: Only shows loading during OTP verification  
✅ **Resend Button**: Only shows loading during resend operation  
✅ **Back to Form Button**: Disabled only when verification actions are running

### User Experience Improvements:
- **No Interference**: Clicking one button doesn't affect others
- **Clear Feedback**: Users know exactly which action is processing
- **Better UX**: Can still interact with other buttons when appropriate
- **Logical Disabling**: Back button disabled during verification actions to prevent state conflicts

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Form Submission
1. Fill out signup form and click "Sign Up"
2. ✅ Only signup button shows loading and gets disabled
3. ✅ Other buttons remain interactive

### Scenario 2: OTP Verification
1. Enter OTP and click "Verify & Complete Registration"
2. ✅ Only verify button shows loading and gets disabled
3. ✅ Resend button remains clickable (if cooldown finished)
4. ✅ Back button gets disabled to prevent conflicts

### Scenario 3: Resend OTP
1. Click "Resend Code"
2. ✅ Only resend button shows loading and gets disabled
3. ✅ Verify button remains clickable
4. ✅ Back button gets disabled to prevent conflicts

### Scenario 4: Back to Form
1. Click "Change Information"
2. ✅ Immediately returns to form (no loading state needed)
3. ✅ Disabled only when verification actions are running

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before:
- Single loading state caused UI confusion
- Poor separation of concerns
- Difficult to debug which action was actually running

### After:
- Clear separation of loading states
- Each action manages its own state
- Easy to debug and maintain
- Better user experience with precise feedback

## Additional Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Easy to add more actions without conflicts
2. **Debugging**: Clear which action is running from state
3. **Accessibility**: Screen readers get proper feedback per action
4. **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders of unrelated components

This fix ensures that each action on the signup page has independent loading states, providing users with clear and accurate feedback about what's happening at any given moment.
