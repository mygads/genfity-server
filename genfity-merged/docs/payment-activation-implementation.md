# Payment Expiration and Service Activation Implementation

## Overview
This implementation addresses the requirements for expired date handling and automatic service activation based on payment and transaction status.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated Expired Date Logic
- **Expired dates now only apply to `created` or `pending` status**
- When payment status changes to `paid`, `failed`, `expired`, `cancelled`, etc., the `expiresAt` field is automatically set to `null`
- When transaction status changes from `created`/`pending` to other statuses, the `expiresAt` field is cleared
- Added `clearExpiredDatesForCompletedItems()` method to clean up expired dates for completed items

### 2. Auto-Activation Logic
Automatic service activation is triggered when:
- Payment status = `paid` 
- Transaction status = `in-progress`

This happens automatically in two places:
- **API endpoint**: `customer/payment/status/[paymentId]` (GET)
- **API endpoint**: `customer/payment/[paymentId]` (GET)

### 3. Services Activated
When activation triggers are met, the system automatically:
- **WhatsApp Services**: Creates or extends `WhatsappApiService` records
- **Product Delivery**: Creates or updates `PackageCustomer` records with `delivered` status

### 4. New API Endpoint
**Route**: `POST /api/customer/transaction/active`
**Purpose**: Manual activation check for transactions

**Usage**:
```json
// POST /api/customer/transaction/active
{
  "transactionId": "transaction_id_here"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "transactionId": "cly123...",
    "status": "in_progress",
    "activated": true,
    "activatedAt": "2025-06-11T10:30:00Z",
    "services": {
      "whatsapp": true,
      "product": false
    }
  },
  "message": "Transaction services activated successfully"
}
```

**Validation**: Only works if transaction status is `in-progress` and payment status is `paid`

### 5. Additional Helper Endpoint
**Route**: `GET /api/customer/transaction/active`
**Purpose**: Get list of transactions eligible for manual activation

## Implementation Details

### PaymentExpirationService Updates
- `updatePaymentStatus()`: Now clears expiration dates when status changes
- `autoActivateServices()`: New method to activate both WhatsApp and product services
- `activateWhatsAppServiceForTransaction()`: WhatsApp service activation logic
- `activateProductDelivery()`: Product delivery activation logic  
- `checkAndActivateTransaction()`: Manual activation validation and execution
- `clearExpiredDatesForCompletedItems()`: Cleanup method for expired dates

### Status Flow
1. **Transaction Created** (`created`) → Has expiration date
2. **Payment Created** (`pending`) → Has expiration date
3. **Payment Paid** (`paid`) → Expiration date cleared, transaction moves to `in-progress`
4. **Auto-Activation Triggered** → Services activated, transaction can move to `success`

### Error Handling
- All activation attempts are wrapped in try-catch blocks
- Failed activations are logged but don't break the API response
- Transactions remain in `in-progress` status for manual handling if auto-activation fails

### Logging
Comprehensive logging for debugging:
- `[AUTO_ACTIVATION]`: General service activation
- `[WHATSAPP_ACTIVATION]`: WhatsApp service specific
- `[PRODUCT_DELIVERY]`: Product delivery specific
- `[STATUS_CHECK_ACTIVATION]`: API endpoint activation triggers
- `[CLEAR_EXPIRED_DATES]`: Expiration date cleanup

## Benefits
1. **Real-time Activation**: No need for cron jobs, activation happens immediately when conditions are met
2. **Dual Triggers**: Both API endpoints ensure activation happens when users check payment status
3. **Manual Fallback**: New endpoint allows manual activation if automatic triggers are missed
4. **Clean Data**: Expired dates are automatically cleared when no longer relevant
5. **Flexible**: Supports both WhatsApp services and product delivery activation

## Usage Examples

### Automatic Activation (Most Common)
User checks payment status → API automatically activates services if conditions are met.

### Manual Activation (Fallback)
```javascript
// Check eligible transactions
const response = await fetch('/api/customer/transaction/active');
const eligibleTransactions = await response.json();

// Manually activate a transaction
const activationResponse = await fetch('/api/customer/transaction/active', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ transactionId: 'transaction_id' })
});
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Payment Flow**: Create payment → Pay → Check if services are activated
2. **Test Manual Activation**: Create in-progress transaction with paid payment → Use manual activation endpoint
3. **Test Expiration Cleanup**: Verify expired dates are cleared when status changes
4. **Test Error Cases**: Try manual activation with invalid transaction states
5. **Test Both Service Types**: Test WhatsApp service and product delivery activation separately and together
