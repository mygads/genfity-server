# Product Transaction Migration - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Successfully completed the migration from single `productTransaction` model to multiple `productTransactions` array support across the entire codebase. The system now fully supports multiple products per transaction while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Final Fixes Applied

### 1. Complete Delivery Route Fixed ✅
- **File**: `/api/transactions/[transactionId]/complete-delivery/route.ts`
- **Issue**: Duplicate `payment` property in Prisma include statement
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate property and added missing include statement for the second query

### 2. Users Management Routes Fixed ✅
- **Files**: 
  - `/api/users/[userId]/route.ts`
  - `/api/users/route.ts`
- **Issues**: 
  - Invalid `whatsappApiServices` relation (doesn't exist)
  - TypeScript errors with `_count` property access
- **Fixes**:
  - Changed to use `whatsappCustomers` relation (correct model name)
  - Removed problematic `_count` includes and used direct relation counts
  - Updated delete transaction to use correct model names
  - Fixed stats calculation to use array lengths instead of `_count`

### 3. Route Parameters Fixed ✅
- **Files**: Multiple route handlers
- **Issue**: Next.js 15 compatibility with Promise-based params
- **Fix**: Updated all route handlers to use `params: Promise<{ id: string }>` pattern
